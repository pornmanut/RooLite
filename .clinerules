# Handoff System Rules

Create handoffs when context becomes stale and milestones when features complete. For implementation details, refer to handoffs/0-instructions/.

## When to Create Documents

1. **Create handoffs when:**
   - Context becomes ~30% irrelevant to current task
   - After completing significant project segments
   - After 10+ conversation exchanges
   - During debugging sessions exceeding 5 exchanges without resolution

2. **Create milestones when:**
   - Completing major features or components
   - After 3-5 handoffs accumulate
   - A significant project phase concludes

A fresh LLM session with focused context often solves problems that an overloaded session cannot.
