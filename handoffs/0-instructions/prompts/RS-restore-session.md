# Session Restoration Prompt Template

When returning to a project after breaks or context resets, use this prompt to efficiently restore context from handoffs and milestones.

**For best results, you need to customize this prompt!**

## Template

```
Before we begin, please:

1. Examine the handoffs/ directory structure
2. Check if handoff documents exist in the root directory

If handoff documents exist in the root directory:
   
   A. First review all milestone directories in numerical order
      - Read ONLY the 0-prefixed documents in each milestone directory
      - Skip any numbered documents within milestone directories
   
   B. Then read ALL handoff documents in the root directory in numerical order
      - Pay special attention to the most recent handoff for current state

If NO handoff documents exist in the root directory:
   
   - Review all milestone directories in numerical order
   - Read ONLY the 0-prefixed documents in each milestone directory
   - Skip any numbered documents within milestone directories

After reading, please verify your understanding by:
1. Listing all milestone directories in numerical order
2. Listing all handoff documents you've read (if any)
3. Summarizing the current project state and next steps

This will ensure you have the right context while optimizing token usage.
```

## Project-Specific Customization

Add additional project-specific files to read:

```
Additionally, please read these key project files:
- README.md for project overview
- [specific file paths relevant to your current work]
- [configuration files needed for context]
```

## Advanced Verification

For more comprehensive verification:

```
Please verify your understanding more deeply by:
1. Listing major features completed across all milestones
2. Identifying recurring patterns or lessons from milestone documents
3. Summarizing the most important open issues from handoff documents
4. Explaining the overall project architecture as you understand it
```

## Session Focus

To guide the session toward specific goals:

```
After restoring context, please focus on:
- [specific feature or component to work on]
- [particular problem that needs solving]
- [next steps in the project roadmap]
