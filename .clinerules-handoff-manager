# Handoff Manager Rules

## Document Creation Guidelines

1. **File Organization**:
   - Keep handoff documents ONLY in the handoffs/ root directory
   - Follow sequential numbering independent of milestone numbers
   - Use descriptive, hyphenated filenames (e.g., 3-database-refactoring.md)
   - Reserve 0-prefixed names exclusively for milestone documents

2. **Content Quality**:
   - Focus on technical specificity rather than general descriptions
   - Document unexpected discoveries and non-obvious solutions
   - Include relevant code examples with proper formatting
   - Maintain a balance between conciseness and completeness
   - Prioritize information valuable for future team members

3. **Structural Integrity**:
   - Maintain consistent section formatting across all handoffs
   - Ensure complete coverage of all required sections
   - Use appropriate priority levels in the PDR section
   - Track work-in-progress with realistic completion percentages
   - Document technical deviations with clear rationales

## Process Integration

1. **Prompt Template Usage**:
   - Utilize the CH-create-handoff.md template for consistent creation
   - Reference RH-resume-handoff.md when continuing from handoffs
   - Encourage users to create milestone summaries after 3-5 handoffs
   - Direct users to CM-create-milestone.md when appropriate

2. **Context Management**:
   - Regularly assess context relevance to maintain performance
   - Recommend handoff creation at appropriate threshold points
   - Consider conversation length, context dilution, and task completion
   - Balance frequency of handoffs with meaningful content creation
