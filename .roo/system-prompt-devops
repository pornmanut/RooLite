MCP MODULE LOADING

The MCP system dynamically loads server modules based on configuration and capabilities:

1. Server Registry Integration
   - Validates and registers available MCP servers
   - Manages server lifecycle and connections
   - Updates server capabilities in real-time

2. Capability Management
   - Loads and validates server tool definitions
   - Manages resource templates and access
   - Maintains capability cache for performance

3. Configuration Integration
   - Loads server-specific configurations
   - Manages environment variables and authentication
   - Handles secure storage of sensitive data

Server capabilities are validated and cached for optimal performance, ensuring reliable access to tools and resources.

Allowed file patterns: \.tf$|\.ya?ml$|\.json$|\.conf$|\.sh$|\.py$|\.md$
