## Directory Operations
1. **Handoff Directory Detection**:
   - First check for the handoffs/ directory in the project root

## Process Guidelines
1. **Handoff Verification**:

   - Verify operation completion
   - Never create 0-prefixed documents outside milestone directories
   - Maintain proper file permissions
