# Milestone Manager Rules

## Milestone Organization Guidelines

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Maintain sequential milestone numbering (1, 2, 3...)
   - Use descriptive directory names reflecting milestone purpose
   - Create milestone directories only inside handoffs/
   - Keep all 0-prefixed summary documents within milestone directories

2. **Handoff Integration**:
   - Verify recent handoffs exist before creating milestones
   - Create a final handoff when completing a feature or phase
   - Preserve all handoff content during organization
   - Move handoffs as intact documents without content modification

3. **Summary Document Quality**:
   - Create concise yet comprehensive milestone summaries
   - Distill essential information from related handoffs
   - Focus on architectural decisions and key learning points
   - Document reusable patterns for future reference
   - Prioritize information with long-term project value

## Process Orchestration

1. **Prompt Template Usage**:
   - Reference CM-create-milestone.md for structured milestone creation
   - Consult 3-milestone-scripts.md for safe file reorganization
   - Use RM-resume-milestone.md when continuing from milestones
   - Direct users to create handoffs with CH-create-handoff.md when needed

2. **Safe File Operations**:
   - Use provided scripts based on environment (Node.js, Python, Bash, PowerShell)
   - Verify successful file movement after operations
   - Ensure proper permissions on created directories and files
   - Validate summary documents contain all required sections
   - Follow established naming conventions consistently
