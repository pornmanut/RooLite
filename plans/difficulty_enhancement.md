# Progressive Difficulty Enhancement Plan

## Height-Based Difficulty Zones

### 1. Zone Breakdowns
- **Beginner Zone (0-10000)**
  - Initial learning curve
  - Basic platform patterns
  - Gentle difficulty progression
  - Focus on core mechanics

- **Intermediate Zone (10001-40000)**
  - Introduction of complex elements
  - Varied platform patterns
  - Moderate challenge increase
  - Strategic movement required

- **Advanced Zone (40001-80000)**
  - Complex platform arrangements
  - Challenging patterns
  - Higher skill requirement
  - Quick decision making needed

- **Expert Zone (80001+)**
  - Maximum difficulty
  - Complex pattern combinations
  - High precision required
  - True test of skill

### 2. Zone-Specific Parameters

#### Beginner Zone (0-10000)
- Platform spacing: 80% of max jump height
- Moving platform chance: 0-10%
- Path splitting: Disabled until 5000
- Platform width: 90-100% of max width
- Difficulty multiplier: 1.0 - 1.5

#### Intermediate Zone (10001-40000)
- Platform spacing: 85-90% of max jump height
- Moving platform chance: 10-25%
- Regular path splitting enabled
- Platform width: 80-90% of max width
- Difficulty multiplier: 1.5 - 2.0

#### Advanced Zone (40001-80000)
- Platform spacing: 90-95% of max jump height
- Moving platform chance: 25-40%
- Frequent path splitting
- Platform width: 70-85% of max width
- Difficulty multiplier: 2.0 - 2.5

#### Expert Zone (80001+)
- Platform spacing: 95-100% of max jump height
- Moving platform chance: 40-50%
- Maximum path complexity
- Platform width: 60-80% of max width
- Difficulty multiplier: 2.5 - 3.0

## Implementation Details

### 1. Difficulty Calculation
```python
def calculate_difficulty(height):
    base_difficulty = 1.0
    if height <= 10000:
        return base_difficulty + (height / 10000) * 0.5
    elif height <= 40000:
        return 1.5 + ((height - 10000) / 30000) * 0.5
    elif height <= 80000:
        return 2.0 + ((height - 40000) / 40000) * 0.5
    else:
        return min(3.0, 2.5 + ((height - 80000) / 40000) * 0.5)
```

### 2. Platform Pattern Generation
- Early Game (0-10000):
  - Linear paths
  - Regular spacing
  - Predictable patterns

- Mid Game (10001-40000):
  - Alternating patterns
  - Variable spacing
  - Path splits introduced

- Late Game (40001-80000):
  - Spiral patterns
  - Complex combinations
  - Multiple path options

- Expert Game (80001+):
  - Zigzag patterns
  - Maximum complexity
  - Strategic choices

### 3. Platform Types Distribution

#### Moving Platform Distribution
```python
def get_moving_platform_chance(height):
    if height <= 10000:
        return min(0.10, height / 100000)
    elif height <= 40000:
        return min(0.25, 0.10 + (height - 10000) / 120000)
    elif height <= 80000:
        return min(0.40, 0.25 + (height - 40000) / 100000)
    else:
        return min(0.50, 0.40 + (height - 80000) / 160000)
```

### 4. Safety Mechanisms

#### Guaranteed Safe Platforms
- Every 5 platforms includes one stable platform
- Safety platforms are 20% wider than current zone's standard
- No movement on safety platforms
- Increased spawn rate after long falls

#### Recovery Zones
- Implemented after difficult sections
- More frequent safe platforms
- Slightly wider platforms
- Reduced movement speed
- Short section length (3-5 platforms)

#### Platform Density Control
- Minimum 3 platforms visible on screen
- Maximum gap limited to 95% of max jump height
- Emergency platform spawning for gaps > 90% max jump height

## Required Changes

### 1. PathManager Class
- Add difficulty zone detection
- Implement new platform generation patterns
- Add safety mechanism checks
- Update platform type distribution

### 2. Platform Class
- Add support for variable width based on zone
- Implement zone-specific movement patterns
- Add safety platform variations

### 3. Main Game Loop
- Track player height for zone determination
- Update difficulty calculation
- Implement recovery zone detection
- Add emergency platform spawning

## Testing Requirements

1. Zone Transitions
   - Smooth difficulty progression
   - Proper parameter scaling
   - No sudden difficulty spikes

2. Safety Mechanisms
   - Verify safe platform generation
   - Test emergency platform spawning
   - Validate recovery zones

3. Platform Patterns
